### Plan refinement

---

In the course of the app development, we have decided to remove the fun fact feature, as its value in substantiating our app is much lower than news, music and video.

### Media access instructions

---

As a frontend app without the backend support, to protect API keys and or auth tokens from exposing to the public, we utilise local storage.

- Music: <br>
- News: <br>
- Video: <br>
  To access video, the user must have a valid youtube api key. To apply for youtube API, the user is required to have an account on the Google cloud platform and a named project associated with Youtube Data API v3. API key can be generated under credentials.

### Technologies used

---

- Third party APIs
- Javacript, jQuery and CSS framework
